**May Memo - Photo Filters Catalog**

**SEA-Stage-2-Data-Catalog-Project**

Welcome to the May Memo, Photo Filters Catalog! This is a one-stop-shop for exploring a range of fun and creative photo filters, developed as part of my Snap Engineering Academy's Stage 2 project assessment.

**About the Filters**

I hope this collection offers something for everyone, from classic black and white to vibrant, eye-catching effects. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and find the perfect filter for your needs.

**Live Camera Preview**

With the live camera preview, you can see how each filter will transform your photos in real-time. This interactive feature helps you make informed decisions before capturing the perfect shot.

**About the Creator**

I'm May Yadanar Thein, but my friends and family call me Pan Pan. I've always enjoyed taking photos and playing with fun filters and effects.
Snapchat has been one of my go-to apps for that. That experience inspired me to create this web, which I'm excited to share with you here as part of my Snap Engineering Academy's Stage 2 Project Assessment.

I hope you enjoy exploring the Photo Filters Catalog and finding the perfect filters to elevate your visual storytelling.
